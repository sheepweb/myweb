# CBoard - Modern Subscription Management System

[中文](README_zh.md) | English

---

## 📖 Overview

**CBoard** is a modern, high-performance subscription management system designed for VPN/proxy service providers. Built with Go language, it offers **70-90% memory reduction** compared to Python-based solutions while maintaining full feature parity.

### 💡 Project Origin

This project was initially created to solve a practical need: **securely sharing subscription resources from multiple proxy services with friends while preventing resource abuse**.

**Core Scenario:**
- You have multiple proxy service subscriptions with unused traffic, and want to share them with friends (e.g., for international trade)
- The purchased proxy service packages typically don't limit device count, but you need to control the sharing scope
- Use device count limits to prevent friends from sharing subscriptions with others
- However, there's a problem: friends might download node information and use it separately, losing control

**Solution:**
- The system supports periodic subscription address resets (recommended daily or every two days)
- Automatically collects and aggregates subscription addresses from multiple proxy services
- Generates new aggregated subscription links to share with friends
- Effectively prevents resource abuse through device limits and periodic subscription address updates

**Use Cases:**
- Personal Sharing: Share proxy resources with a small group of friends while controlling usage scope
- Small-scale Commercialization: If you have many friends, you can also operate on a small commercial scale

This design ensures effective resource utilization while preventing resource abuse and leakage through technical means.

### 🎯 Key Features

- 🚀 **High Performance**: Memory usage only 35-95 MB (vs 300-850 MB in Python version)
- ⚡ **Fast Startup**: Millisecond-level startup time
- 🔒 **Secure**: JWT authentication, password encryption, SQL injection protection
- 📦 **Feature Complete**: All core business functions included
- 🎨 **Modern Frontend**: Vue 3 + Element Plus, responsive design
- 🐳 **Easy Deployment**: One-click VPS script (`install-vps.sh`) or BT Panel script (`install.sh`)
- 💳 **Multi-Payment**: Alipay, WeChat Pay, PayPal, Apple Pay, Yipay
- 👥 **User Management**: Complete user system with levels, invites, and rewards
- 📊 **Analytics**: Comprehensive statistics and monitoring
- 🎫 **Ticket System**: Built-in customer support system

   - Production environment must explicitly specify allowed domains
   - Do not use wildcard `*`

4. **Database Security**
   - Regular database backups
   - Ensure correct file permissions when using SQLite

5. **System Security**
   - Regularly update system and dependencies
   - Configure firewall rules
   - Use strong password policies

---

## 📝 Database Backup

### Automatic Backup (Recommended)

Configure scheduled task in BT Panel:

1. **Scheduled Tasks** → **Add Scheduled Task**
2. **Task Type**: Shell Script
3. **Task Name**: CBoard Database Backup
4. **Execution Cycle**: Daily at 00:02
5. **Script Content**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /www/wwwroot/cboard
BACKUP_DIR="/www/backup/cboard"
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR
cp cboard.db $BACKUP_DIR/cboard_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db
# Keep backups from last 7 days
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "cboard_*.db" -mtime +7 -delete
```

### Manual Backup

```bash
cd /www/wwwroot/cboard
cp cboard.db cboard.db.backup.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

### Backup via API

The system also provides backup API endpoint (admin only):
- `POST /api/v1/admin/backup/create` - Create backup

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### 1. Service Cannot Start

**Check logs**:
```bash
# View service logs
journalctl -u cboard -f

# View application logs
tail -f /www/wwwroot/cboard/uploads/logs/app.log
```

**Common causes**:
- Port occupied: Check if port 8000 is used by another program
- Permission issues: Ensure project directory permissions are correct
- Configuration errors: Check `.env` file configuration

### 2. 502 Bad Gateway

- Check if backend service is running: `systemctl status cboard`
- Check if port is correct: `netstat -tlnp | grep 8000`
- Check `proxy_pass` address in Nginx configuration

### 3. SSL Certificate Application Failed

- Ensure domain is correctly resolved to server IP
- Ensure port 80 is open
- Check firewall settings

### 4. Database Permission Error

```bash
cd /www/wwwroot/cboard
chmod 666 cboard.db
chown www:www cboard.db
```

### 5. Frontend Cannot Access Backend API

- Check if `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` in `.env` includes your domain
- Check if `/api/` proxy in Nginx configuration is correct

### 6. Admin Login Issues

- Reset admin password using installation script (option 2)
- Unlock account: `go run scripts/unlock_user.go <username-or-email>`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **First-Time Setup**
   - After installation, immediately change the default admin password
   - Update `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` file
   - Configure email settings for password reset and notifications

2. **Database**
   - SQLite is used by default (no installation needed)
   - For production with high traffic, consider MySQL or PostgreSQL
   - Regular backups are essential

3. **Security**
   - Never commit `.env` file to version control
   - Use strong passwords for all accounts
   - Enable HTTPS in production
   - Regularly update dependencies

4. **Performance**
   - For high-traffic scenarios, consider using MySQL/PostgreSQL
   - Enable Nginx caching for static files
   - Monitor server resources regularly

5. **Updates**
   - Always backup database before updating
   - Test updates in staging environment first
   - Review changelog before updating
